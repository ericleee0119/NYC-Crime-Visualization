# NYC-Crime-Visualization
## Introduction  
My project dedicates to doing research on the criminal. I would like to visualize the happen of the criminal in New York City.
I thought the readers will be interested in this topic because this project could provide criminal information. The information could show the happening location of the criminal which includes the area or even the longitude and latitude. People could visualize a location that has a lot of crimes and avoid getting to this place. A mapping company such as Google could also add a function to navigate the user to their location without passing by this dangerous place.
According to the dataset I found, the dataset includes information with the time, date, location, crime types, etc.
In my project, I implemented the dashboard, therefore, the user can select the specific information, they are more likely to see.
